# Brain Tumor Detection Using Vision Transformer  

## Introduction  

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from medical images using **Vision Transformer (ViT)**. By leveraging deep learning and transformer-based architectures, this model aims to achieve **high accuracy and robustness** in tumor classification. The project utilizes publicly available medical imaging datasets to train and evaluate the model, providing an **efficient and scalable** solution for brain tumor detection.  

## Features  

- **Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification**: Utilizes transformer-based architecture for superior feature extraction and classification.  
- **Medical Image Processing**: Includes preprocessing techniques like **normalization, resizing, and data augmentation** to enhance model performance.  
- **High Accuracy & Robustness**: Optimized hyperparameters and fine-tuning strategies for improved classification accuracy.  

## Model  

- The **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model is employed for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.  
- The model benefits from **self-attention mechanisms**, allowing it to focus on relevant regions of the image for better decision-making.  

## Dataset  

The project utilizes the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**, which contains labeled MRI scans for training and evaluation. The dataset is available on Kaggle:
